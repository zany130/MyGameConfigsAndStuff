#                                  Introduction
<!--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------->
My personal collection of bash utility scripts, meant to support a wide range of
applications; but not very useful by themselves.
You can find more details and similar tools on
[Yet Another Linux'n Electronics Blog](https://yalneb.blogspot.com/).


*DISCLAIMER*
Note that some script snippets might be from third parties.
I collected them over many years from forums, wikis, and chats.
The original authors, if known, are referenced within the individual scripts.
If you recognize a snippet and the file has no reference
(specially in the older ones), kindly let me know.

### Git branches

There are two branches in this repository:

* **master**: this is the main branch, and thus contains fully functional 
  scripts. When you want to use the scripts as an _user_, 
  this is the branch you want to clone or download.
* **develop**: this branch contains all the new features and most recent 
  contributions. It is always _stable_, in the sense that you can use it
  without major inconveniences. 
  However, its very prone to undetected bugs and it might be subject to major
  unanounced changes. If you want to contribute, this is the branch 
  you should pull-request to.
